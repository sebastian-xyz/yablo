# YABLO
**Y**et **A**nother **B**attery **L**ife **O**ptimizer for Linux üêß

Yablo reduces the energy consumption of the CPU by automatically setting the CPU governor and Turbo Boost dependend on the battery state and system load.
It is highly inspired by [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq).
The application is written in Rust.
